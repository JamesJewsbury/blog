# My First Hugo Post

Welcome to my first blog post! This one’s mostly me figuring out how Markdown works with Hugo. Honestly, Markdown is like the IKEA furniture of writing—it looks simple, but one wrong move and you’ve summoned Cthulhu instead of a side table.

## What I Like About Markdown

- It’s clean
- It’s readable
- It doesn’t require 14 toolbars and a nervous breakdown
- You can write like a hacker while still talking about soup recipes

Here’s a quick example of **inline code**: `console.log("Hello, Markdown!")`

## Code Block Example

Let’s pretend we’re working on something useful, like a function to reverse a string.

```python
def reverse_string(text):
    return text[::-1]

print(reverse_string("baz is god"))
# Output: "dog si zab"
